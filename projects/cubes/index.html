		Cubes

	<p>
		An infinite runner with cubes created in unity.
		Play it <a href="play">here</a>.

	<h2 id="re-rooting">Re-rooting</h2>
	<p>
		To allow the game to be infinite, whilst also avoiding floating point errors, the game world is periodically 're-rooted'.
		This involves moving the player and all objects back a certain distance in one frame. Objects behind the player can be safely removed.
	</p>
	<img width="100%" src="images/cubes.gif">
	<p>
		However, it may prove challenging to get to a distance where floating point errors occur!
	</p>

	<h2 id="world-generation">World generation</h2>
	<p>
		The world is generated using a Markov Chain containing transitions from segments to segments.
		Segments may be prefabricated or programatically generated.
	</p>
	<img width="100%" src="images/cubes_markov_chain.svg">
	<p>
		The square boxes denote a segment with 0 length and simplify the building of the Markov Chain.
		They are similar to an epsilon transition in a state machine.
