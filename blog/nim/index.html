<p>I recently attended a talk by Simon Peyton Jones titled “Immutability
changes everything: 40 years of functional programming” which roughly
chronologed Simon’s research career. In this talk Simon described how he
originally became interested in Computer Science through two problems:
the Angry Bank Customer and Nim.</p>
<h2 id="angry-bank-customer"><a href="#angry-bank-customer"
class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">Angry Bank Customer</a></h2>
<p>Consider the scenario: you’re a overworked bank teller who, every
week, has the same angry customer. This customer demands to withdraw a
varying amount of money each week, and becomes irate if you cannot hand
them their desired amount immediately. How, aside from more diplomatic
means, can you satisfy this customer?</p>
<p>You decide to prepare piles of cash such that you can make up his
desired amount by grabbing a combination. Starting with a £1 pile and a
£2 pile, you can make up to £3. So you add a pile of £4. Which this you
can make any number up to £7 (e.g. 5=4+1, 6=4+2, 7=4+3), so you add a £8
pile, a £16 pile, a £32 pile. Before you know it, you’ve reinvented the
binary numeral system.</p>
<p>While this is a relatively straightforward example, the second
problem poses a more challenging statement also relying on base-2.</p>

<h2 id="s6-ah-computing-project"><a href="#s6-ah-computing-project"
class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">S6 AH Computing Project</a></h2>
<p>I went to school in Scotland, where as part of Senior Phase 6
Advanced Higher Computing Project</p>
<p>The reason why my ears perked up at the mention of Nim was because
this was the game I chose to implement for my Advanced Higher Computing
Project.</p>
<p>But you only have</p>
<p>S6 AH Computing Proiject</p>
<p>Nim - Honestly don’t remember where I found this game, but I thought
it was interesting.</p>
<p>And once you know the trick, building a perfect AI opponent is
trivial.</p>
<p>Haven’t thought about this in years, apart from adding a repo and
trying and failure to compile it (an interesting exercise in
reproducibility)</p>
<p>Inane requirements - like writing out the entire program in pseuocode
beforehand and using a strict waterful methodology</p>
<p>I had been taught Vb, had friend’s learning Python &amp; JAva, but I
really only knew how to code in the Visual Studio IDE. I had enough
foresight to want to move away from Visual Basic, and C# was a natural
choice due to IDE support and feature parity (same IR)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_C_Sharp_and_Visual_Basic_.NET</p>
<p>This started my prefered way of learning programming languages: just
start building something and figure things out from there. Normally this
means getting stuck and consulting stack overflow or preferable the
documentation. I view programming as kind of like riding a bike - it’s
all well and good to read a textbook on how to do it but to do it in
reality you need to practive</p>
<p>needless to say some of these were completed</p>
